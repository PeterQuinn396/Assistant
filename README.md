# Assistant


## Update 11/07/2019 
This project was started in the summer of 2018, but never really got too far off the ground. The Google AI Voice Kit for the Raspberry Pi is a pretty fun and well made little thing, but the functionality of the google assistant library was a little lackluster. Primarily, it lacked some of the attractive functions of true Google Homes like the ability to set alarms/timers, and to play music through Spotify. There was also no simple/ elegant way to change the hotword detection from "Okay/Hey Google" to something more interesting. As such, this project is going to pivot to something that is more of a device with some interesting hardware controlled google assistant voice commands through webhooks over IFTTT.
